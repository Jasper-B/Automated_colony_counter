# Automated_colony_counter
This python script was written to automatically calculate the amount of bacterial colonies grown on agar plates.

The function accesses the webcam and when a plate is put underneath, the picture is returned with the labelled and counted colonies. The script works well for agar plates that have enough contrast between the plate medium and the bacterial colonies, however, when colonies are touching each other I have not succeeded into separating these.
